# LIRI-Bot

LIRI-Bot is a **Node.js** program that I created to give you access to simple 
information through the use of a few different APIs. I used the Spotify API to 
get access to a song search, this command is run with "spotify-this-song _songname_", 
and will return the top 5 songs that match the song entered by the user. I used the 
OMDb API to create a movie search command, this can be run using "movie-this _moviename_",
and will return some information about the movie you search for. Another API I used was 
the BandsInTown API, with this API I could write a command to search for upcoming concerts 
for any artist you give it. This command is run with "concert-this _artistname_", and 
will list the next 6 concerts for the specified artist. The last command I wrote is called
"do-what-it-says" which will look into "random.txt" and retrieve the commands given to it 
in that file and run what is in that file. "do-what-it-says" is the only argument you need 
to pass into LIRI-Bot for that command to work.
